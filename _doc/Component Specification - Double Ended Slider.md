# Component Specification
## Double Ended Slider
The `DoubleEndedSliderComponent` defines the lower and upper bounds of a variable. Interaction is done via the manipulation of two knobs on a linear slider. It is preceded or followed by a button with the variable name which can be used to reset the knobs to their initial positions. Hovering the component with the mouse pointer shows labels over the knobs, displaying the integer values of their positions.
